# Path Finding Visualizer for Drone Delivery

## Project Overview

This project provides a visualizer for exploring different pathfinding algorithms in the context of drone delivery. The application allows users to visualize how various algorithms, such as A*, Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Search, work in navigating a drone through a simulated environment.

## Features

- **Visualization of Pathfinding Algorithms**:  The project visualizes the execution of popular pathfinding algorithms.
- **Interactive Environment**: Users can define the environment (obstacles, start/end points) and visualize different algorithms in real-time.
- **Drone Delivery Simulation**: The environment mimics drone delivery scenarios, allowing users to understand how pathfinding impacts drone delivery efficiency.

## Installation

The project appears to utilize Python. It is recommended to create a virtual environment for isolation and proper dependency management.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x

**Installation:**

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Project:**
   ```bash
   python Project.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Visualizer:**

   - Adjust the environment: Add or remove obstacles, set start and end points, etc.
   - Select the desired pathfinding algorithm.
   - Execute the algorithm and observe the visualized path. 

3. **Explore different algorithms:**  
    - Switch between different algorithms to compare their performance and behavior in the simulated environment.
